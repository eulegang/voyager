# Voyager Eulegang

my [voyager keyboard config](https://www.zsa.io/voyager)


# Workflow

this might be out of the ordinary

follow the setup in the [firmware repo](https://github.com/zsa/qmk_firmware)

and symlink this repo in at `keyboards/voyager/keymaps/eulegang`

then run `make voyager:eulegang` in the firmware repo, and use [keymapp](https://www.zsa.io/flash#flash-keymapp) to flash on to the voyager keyboard
